<h1>The roles that a computer can take in a networked world</h1>



<body>



<h3>Dumb Terminal</h3>

<p>A dumb terminal is a device that usually consists of a keyboard, a monitor, and a network card that is connected to a server or a powerful computer to which they are connected for computations, data processing and data management.</p>



<h3>Thin Client</h3>

<p>A thin client is relatively low performance terminal, which heavily but not entirely, depends on the server to which it is connected.</p>



<h3>Client</h3>

<p>A client receives data via the network, whereas the server has saved data on it and offers it to clients.</p>



<h3>Email Server</h3>

<p>A email server is the equivalent of a post office that manages the flow of email in and out of the network, checks that an email address is valid, allows the user to access their email.</p>



<h3>Router</h3>

<p>A router is a networking device that accepts incoming quanta of information, reads their destination address and distributes them across networks, according to a routing table or routing policy. A router identifies the destination of messages and sends them via an appropriate route and is used to forward data packets between networks.</p>



<h3>Domain Name System Server</h3>

<p>A DNS server attributes names to network addresses and therefore resolves names by assigning them to appropriate network entity.</p>



<h3>Firewall</h3>

<p>A firewall is a hardware or software network infrastructure that controls data flow access among network entities. The firewall is mainly used to offer protection and limit access to a network.</p>



<h3>Client-Server</h3>

<p>A client-server refers to a software network architecture system where clients request information and servers perform tasks in order to provide the information.</p>
    

<h1>Social and ethical issues</h1>
    
<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p>How well an IT system functions. Computer failures cause data loss, time loss, money loss injury or even death. The reliability of IT systems determines confidence in their values.</p>
    

<h3>Integrity</h3>

<p>Refers to protecting the completeness and accuracy of data. Data lacks integrity if it is incomplete, out of date, or has been purposely or unintentionally altered.</p>

    
<h3>Inconsistency</h3>

<p>Problems may also arise if information is duplicated in a database and only one copy is updated, causing inconsistency (e.g. telephone field)</p>
    

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Refers to protection of hardware, software, peripherals and computer networks' from unauthorized access.</p>
    
    
    
<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>The ability to control how and to what extent data is used and disseminated to others.</p>

    
    
<h3>Anonymity</h3>

<p>Privacy becomes anonymity when an individual uses an IT system to conceal his/her true identity in order to cyber-bully another person, commit illegal actions or crimes such as hacking computers.</p>
    
    

<h3>Intellectual property</h3>

<p>Refers to ideas and scientific endavours. Copyright laws are designed to protect intellectual property from unauthorized and illegal reproduction.</p>
    
    
    
<h3>Digital divide and equality of access</h3>

<p>The growth and the use of IT systems have not developed at the same rate for everybody in all parts of the world, or in all areas of the same country.</p>
    
    

<h3>Surveillance</h3>

<p>Involves  using IT to monitor individuals or groups of people either with or without their knowledge or permission.</p>
    
    
    
<h3>Globalization</h3>

<p>IT helps to diminish the importance of geographical, political, economic and cultural boudaries while speeding up the global spread of political, financial, sport and cultural news.</p>
